# Arizona Digital Design System

A design token and Storybook workspace for the Arizona Digital design system. This repo contains the source token definitions, generated token output, and a Storybook environment for reviewing and validating visual tokens.

## Repository Structure

This is an npm workspaces monorepo with two packages:

```text
├── packages/
│   ├── tokens/                 # @az-digital/tokens — design token source and build output
│   │   ├── tokens.json         #   source DTCG token definitions
│   │   ├── terrazzo.config.ts
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── storybook/             # @az-digital/storybook — private Storybook preview
│       ├── src/               #   token catalog logic and tests
│       ├── stories/           #   Storybook stories
│       ├── .storybook/       #   Storybook config
│       └── package.json
├── package.json               # workspace root
├── README.md                  # this file
└── .gitignore
```

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@az-digital/tokens` | `packages/tokens/` | Source token definitions and Terrazzo build pipeline |
| `@az-digital/storybook` | `packages/storybook/` | Storybook UI for token review and documentation |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

## Getting Started

```bash
# from the repo root
npm install

# start Storybook
npm run dev:storybook
```

Storybook will be available at http://localhost:6006.

## Available Scripts

All scripts can be run from the repo root:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev:storybook` | Start the Storybook development server |
| `npm run build:storybook` | Build Storybook for production output |
| `npm run build:tokens` | Build token output using Terrazzo |
| `npm run test:storybook` | Run the Storybook package tests |
| `npm run lint:storybook` | Run ESLint for the Storybook package |
| `npm run build:all` | Build token output and Storybook assets |

## Token Workflow

1. Update token values in `packages/tokens/tokens.json`.
2. Run the token build script:

```bash
npm run build:tokens
```

3. Review the generated token catalog in Storybook.

## Storybook Notes

The Storybook package renders the design token catalog, groups nested token values, and provides a review surface for design decisions and naming conventions.

It also includes small validation tests covering token grouping and metadata parsing so token structure changes are caught early.

## Related Standards

This project follows the broader design token ecosystem and aligns with the [Design Tokens Technical Reports](https://www.designtokens.org/technical-reports/), including the specification work that informs structured token definitions and interoperability.

## How It Works

- Tokens are authored in a structured JSON format and stored in `packages/tokens/tokens.json`.
- The token package builds output through Terrazzo.
- Storybook reads the token source and renders grouped token cards for review.
- The package test suite verifies that nested token paths are flattened and grouped correctly.

## Contributing

When updating tokens or Storybook behavior:

1. Keep the token structure intentional and consistent.
2. Use Storybook to review the rendered output.
3. Run the relevant tests before shipping changes.

This repo is intended to support both token authoring and visual review in one place, with Storybook acting as the primary design review surface.
